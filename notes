        <h1>Understanding Usability and Its Importance</h1>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION TO USABILITY</h2>
        <p>“Usability is about human behavior. It recognizes that humans are lazy, get emotional,
            are not interested in putting a lot of effort into, say, getting a credit card and generally
             prefer things that are easy to do vs. those that are hard to do.” — David McQuillen, ex-Swiss banker and 
             founder of Sufferfest cycling workout resources</p>
            <p>Usability is a <strong>quality attribute</strong> that assesses
                how easy user interfaces are to use. The word
                "usability" also refers to methods for improving
                ease-of-use during the design process.</p>

            <h3>Definition of <strong>Useful</strong></h3>
            <p>usability + utility</p>
            <h2>Why Usability Is Important?</h2>
            <p> On the Web, usability is a necessary condition for survival. If
            a website is difficult to use, people leave. If
            the homepage fails to clearly state what a company offers
            and what users can do on the site, people leave. If users get
            lost on a website, they leave. If a website's information is
            hard to read or doesn't answer users' key questions,
            they leave. </p>
            <h2>Usability Elements For Exceptional Experiences</h2>
            <p>People often confuse usability with user experience
                and <strong>ease of use</strong>. Usability is a component of <strong>user
                experience (UX) design</strong>. According to the <strong>Nielsen
                Norman Group</strong>—a leader in the UX field—usability is
                the <strong>second level in user experience</strong>. It comes
                after <strong> utility</strong> and before <strong>desirability</strong> and <strong>brand experience</strong>.
               </p>

               <ol>
                <li>Effectiveness— It supports users in completing actions accurately.</li>
                <li>Efficiency— Users can perform tasks quickly through the easiest process.</li>
                <li>Engagement— Users find it pleasant to use and appropriate for its
                    industry/topic.</li>
                <li>Error Tolerance —It supports a range of user actions and only shows an
                    error in genuine erroneous situations. You achieve this by finding out the
                    number, type and severity of common errors users make, as well as
                    how easily users can recover from those errors.</li>
                <li>Ease of Learning—New users can accomplish goals easily and even more
                        easily on future visits.</li>
               </ol>

              </ul>
            <h2>How to Improve Usability</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Get hold of some <strong>representative users</strong>, such as customers for an
                    ecommerce site or employees for an intranet (in the latter case, they
                    should work outside your department).</li>
                <li>Ask the users to perform <strong>representative tasks</strong> with the design.</li>
                <li><strong>Observe</strong> what the users do, where they succeed, and where they
                        have difficulties with the user interface. Shut up and <strong>let the users do
                        the talking</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>When to Work on Usability</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Before starting the new design, test the old design to identify the good parts that you should keep or emphasize,
                        and the bad parts that give users trouble.</li>
                    <li>Unless you're working on an intranet, test your competitors' designs to get cheap data on a range of alternative
                        interfaces that have similar features to your own. (If you work on an intranet, read the intranet design annual to learn
                        from other designs.)</li>
                    <li>Conduct a field study to see how users behave in their natural habitat.</li>
                    <li>Make paper prototypes of one or more new design issdeas and test them. The less time you invest in these design
                        ideas the better, because you'll need to change them all based on the test results.
                        </li>
                    <li>Refine the design ideas that test best through multiple iterations, gradually moving from low-fidelity prototyping to
                        high-fidelity representations that run on the computer. Test each iteration.</li>
                    <li>Inspect the design relative to established usability guidelines whether from your own earlier studies or published
                        research.</li>
                    <li>Once you decide on and implement the final design, test it again. Subtle usability problems always creep in during
                        implementation.</li>
                </ol> 
                <h2>Components of Usability</h2>
                <h3>"Key Components of Usability"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> The accuracy and completeness with
                        which users can achieve their goals</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The speed and resource usage in relation to
                            the achieved goals</li>
                            <li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> The subjective experience and user
                                satisfaction with the interaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>USER-CENTERED DESIGN</h2>
                <p>"Usability is at the core of User-Centered Design. UCD involves
                    understanding the user's needs,
                    preferences, and context throughout
                    the design process."</p>

                <h2>The Business Case for Usability</h2>
                <h3>"Business Impact of Usability"</h3>
                <h3>Points:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher user satisfaction leads to increased customer
                        loyalty.</li>
                        <li>Improved usability reduces support costs and the
                            need for extensive user training.</li>
                            <li>Usable products are more likely to gain positive
                                reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations.</li>                        
                </ul>
                <h2>Usability vs. User Experience</h2>
                <p>Efficiency, error tolerance, ease of learning and user
                    comfort are the main usability goals. The goal is to answer
                    the question “Is it easy to use?”</p>
                    <p>In contrast, user experience focuses on creating value,
                    satisfaction and an engaging experience. The goal of user
                    experience is to answer the question “Does it feel good?”</p>
